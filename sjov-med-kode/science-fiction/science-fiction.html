        <p class="text1">Science fiction film is a film genre that uses science fiction: speculative,<br> science-based depictions of phenomena that are not necessarily accepted<br> by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial life forms, alien worlds,<br> extrasensory perception, and time travel, often along with futuristic<br> elements such as spacecraft, robots, or other technologies.<br> Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or<br> social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.<br> In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by<br> filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific<br> plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.</p><br>
        <p class="text2">The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema, when Georges Melies'<br> A Trip to the Moon (1902) amazed audiences with its trick photography effects.<br> The next major example in the genre was the 1927 film Metropolis. From the 1930s<br> to the 1950s, the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B-movies. After Stanley<br> Kubrick's 1968 landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey, the science fiction film genre<br> was taken more seriously. In the late 1970s, big-budget science fiction films filled<br> with special effects became popular with audiences after the success of Star Wars<br> and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent decades.</p><br><br>
